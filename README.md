RecoverMonitor: Edge-enabled Open-source Wearable Devices for Monitoring Healthcare Remote Patient Recovery with Precision and Efficiency

Patient monitoring has always been a critical aspect in the recovery of healthcare patients. Towards that goal, this talk provides an in-depth overview of how open-source wearables devices using cloud & edge-computing platform can provide precision and efficiency to healthcare providers. Our use case enables tracking, monitoring, and alerting in various scenarios and settings, such as around-the-clock health remote monitoring of smart data like body temperature, blood oxygen, and heart rate of the patients. The goal is to ensure patient safety during medical procedure recovery and/or rehabilitation. This talk provides valuable insights into building secure and reliable applications for wearable devices using open-source operating system together with an open-source edge computing platform called KubeEdge, which offers the benefit of lower latency and enhanced end-user experience to patients. Our talk demonstrates the benefits and opportunities evolving out of the open-source ecosystem towards enablement of the next generation emerging applications landscape. A cloud-edge synergy based smart early warning system can be built to support healthcare providers to evaluate the data and offer treatment and prevention.
